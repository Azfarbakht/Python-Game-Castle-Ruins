# Python Game Castle Ruins
 A 2D Platformer game I made casually. It's built using the Arcade library. All image assets have been aquired free from craftpix and the map was created using Tiled.


# How to run

to run the game on your PC: 
1. Make sure you have Python Version 3.x installed on your computer
2. Navigate to the directory (using cd) containing these files and then run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run python3 myGame.py
